# Hand-Gesture-Controlled-Volume-Python-
This Python script uses computer vision and the MediaPipe library to detect hand gestures from a webcam feed and control the system's audio volume based on the hand gesture. By performing specific hand gestures in front of your webcam, you can easily adjust your computer's audio volume without touching any buttons.
